With the brainstorm results, I sketched some solutions and test them with my potential users. As soon as I got green lights on my concept idea, I noted down some user stories, and based on further interviews, ranked them. It was super important to stay close to my userbase, because it is through empathy that you create meaningful solutions. When developing my first couple of iterations in vanillajs, I noticed how difficult it would get to scale. I made the hasty decision to switch to Reactjs and used react-three-fiber to create a rapid prototype. This project was probably my favorite project ever, because of the amount of research, brainstorming and discussions with stakeholders that went into this.
