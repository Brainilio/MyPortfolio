To me, this project felt like a test to prove how meaningful my ideas can be to others. I started this process off doing thorough research on environmental racism.

Shortly after making a couple of assumptions, I made the decision to interview some members of the latino community in LA in order to confirm or get rid of assumptions. After getting enough results, I worked out a frame your design challenge in order to frame a how might we question. With the brainstorm results, I sketched some solutions and test them with my potential users. As soon as I got green lights on my concept idea, I noted down some user stories, and based on further interviews, ranked them. It was super important to stay close to my userbase, because it is through empathy that you create meaningful solutions. When developing my first couple of iterations in vanillajs, I noticed how difficult it would get to scale. I made the hasty decision to switch to Reactjs and used react-three-fiber to create a rapid prototype. This project was probably my favorite project ever, because of the amount of research, brainstorming and discussions with stakeholders that went into this.

I made a reservation system for my mother\u2019s salon in pure PHP, HTML/Materialize & MySQL. This was my first time interacting with these languages, yet I was able to develop a reservation system for my mother at the time with a login-system and a dashboard with CRUD functionalities to view all of the reservations you have ahead of you. Only the admin (Maria) has access to all reservations and employee accounts. The front-end was developed using materialize/css and I used a weather API to display the weather in Rotterdam. Note: the file structure is terrible, but this was my first web-app, so expect spaghetti code upon reviewing.",process:"As this was my first web application I thought it would be very important to know exactly what my mother wanted, so I scheduled to do some interviews with stakeholders to get to know potential users. After doing proper reserach, I set up a customer journey & a persona. Based on these personas I developed user stories and ordered them using Moscow Analysis. After doing this, I developed a couple of wireframes, tested them and held a debriefing with my mom for a desired launch-date. When my designs got approved, I made a flowchart analysis to truly lay out the system processes for myself. After doing the UX/UI process, I started getting familiar with PHP and MySQL by doing online courses and just trying out things for myself. I remember the big smile on my face when I first interacted with the database and saw my data being manipulated. I had SO much joy, and knew exactly that this is what I wanted to keep doing for the rest of my life. After wrapping up the back-end, I went ahead and developed the front-end in Materialize and tested my application with users. After getting green lights, I was happy to announce my first iteration of the application. ",challenges:"The hardest challenge was not being familiar with PHP and MySQL.
