My solution is a web-application using three-js to display the art of Boyle Heights in a virtual world. However, it is very hard for the user to see the art because of toxic-like fog covering the art. This toxic fog represents the pollution in the area and it is actually based on the actual AQI in Boyle Heights. I use an official air quality index API. So the worse the actual air quality, the harder it would be to see the art. With this visual representation, I hope to awaken the fact that people would love to preserve, and here it comes, SAVE the culture, the neighborhood, the art, the people, and the lives of Boyle Heights by getting in action against environmental racism, this also explains the name SALVAME. ",process:"I took a very big leap in my learning when starting this project. To me, this project felt like a test to prove how meaningful my creations can be to others. I started this process off doing thorough research on environmental racism. I did this through field-research and desk-research. Shortly after making a couple of assumptions for myself, I decided to interview some members of the latino community in LA in order to confirm or get rid of assumptions I made. After getting enough results, I decided to do a frame your design challenge in order to frame a how might we question. After doing brainstorming, I decided to sketch some solutions and test them with my potential users. After getting green lights on the current salvame idea. I noted down some user stories, and based on further interviews I prioritized them. It was super important to stay close to my userbase, because that is how you create the best solutions, through empathy. After developing my first couple of iterations in vanillajs, i noticed how difficult it would be to scale this. I decided to switch to reactjs and used react-three-fiber to create the current prototype. This project was probably my favorite project ever, because of the amount of research and brainstorming that went into this. Secondly, being in contact with stakeholders was extra hard, because of COVID. I know how hard COVID has struck the latin community, in LA especially, and I had to be mindful of this. This lead to me making more assumptions on certain solutions.",challenges:"When it was time to actually develop the prototype, I was not as proficient in React or 3JS. I started this project off in VanillaJS, but noticed quickly how difficult it was to work with different components.
